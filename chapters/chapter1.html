        <p>The luxury, wooden themed living room with tall ceilings seemed to be cramped by the men in suits that uniformly sat across the beige leather couches around. A beefy man, wearing his signature yellow polo shirt with his grey flat cap cleared his throat with a guttural vibration that resonated throughout this extremely silent home. He carefully removed a paper from a golden envelope, adjusted his glasses, and read as clearly as possible:

“If you’re reading this, I’m in jail for a very long time or I am dead. We know the type of work we do here, and I’ve known that this day was inevitable. I won’t make this too long and just state what needs to happen. Any unfinished business that was planned under me may be considered abandoned. If the decision within this new team is to continue then so be it. Otherwise, I have given up all ownership and management of the Kalto Group. I have picked Kojo Asumani as my successor, and this is the one and only request I demand you follow. Thank you to everyone, and all the best. God bless.”
He peered above his note to see everyone stand up from their seats. All but one. In the corner seat of the whole room, Kojo sat straight-faced in his black, sleek suit. One by one, they went around the central marble table bending on one knee and shaking his hand whilst uttering the same words, “I am honoured, my chief.” At the end of it all he continued staring at the flames that James was stoking. He knew this would happen. In his life there was a pattern of extreme greatness and extreme downfalls that followed him often and particularly now, whether by conscientization or physical conviction, the hairs on the back of his neck had already begun to stand before James finished reading the letter. The room had already started to empty, and he still sat there in that same stance.
Chief of the Kalta Group. A new era was on the horizon.
Twenty-eight years ago, a drowsy, happy woman held a newborn baby in her arms with her young husband sleeping on the chair by the bed, whilst holding her hand. This couple had a couple of children already and they were determined about the fact that this child would be their last. Marinating in the joy of new life, the doctor slyly slipped into the room with a paper in her hand. The man immediately woke up from his sleep sensing something was off from this quiet entrance.
“We have run all the tests and got our final report back. I am not here to deliver any bad news, but I still want you to be open to new life experiences.”
Immediately the couple’s faces were overcome with sadness rather than concern. Tears began welling up in the mother’s eyes and it looked as if they were doomed to resignation.
“Your son is a completely healthy boy in all metrics with no evidence of postnatal effects or congenital diseases arising in your child.”
